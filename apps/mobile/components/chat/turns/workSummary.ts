 * Work Summary
 *
 * Pure label/stats module for `WorkGroup` and the "Worked for X"
 * header. Tallies a run of work-tool parts into buckets (files
 * edited, files read, searches, fetches, commands), classifies the
 * run's `kind`, and builds the Cursor-style one-line label:
 *
 *   Explored 14 files, 9 searches, ran 4 commands
 *   Edited 11 files, explored 3 searches, 1 fetch, ran 13 commands
 *   Editing 32 files, explored 1 search, ran 23 commands   (present tense)
 *   Ran 3 commands
 *
 * The leading verb reflects `tense` ("Edited"/"Editing"); the
 * trailing "explored …" / "ran …" segments are always past tense —
 * each of those sub-actions already resolved even while the overall
 * group (e.g. a batch of edits) is still in progress.
 *
 * Pure module — no React imports. Safe to unit-test directly.

 * Per-tool-call cache for the (added, removed) line-diff counts an edit

 * `groupWorkParts` (see `turnShaping.ts`) always returns fresh `items` array
 * references on every streaming tick — even for work-groups that finished
 * minutes ago — so `WorkGroup`'s `useMemo(() => summarizeWork(items, ...),
 * [items, isStreaming])` can never cache-hit on `items` identity while the
 * message keeps streaming. Without this cache, a turn with N sizeable edits
 * keeps re-running `computeLineDiff`'s O(m*n) LCS diff for every edit, ~20x a
 * second, for as long as the message keeps streaming — measured to cost
 * 10ms+ per tick for a 20-edit/300-line-file turn, which is most of a 60fps
 * frame budget on top of everything else the streaming turn is already
 * paying for.
 *
 * Keyed by tool call id (unique and immutable once a tool call exists).
 * Only populated once the tool call is no longer streaming (`state !==
 * "streaming"`), since `old_string`/`new_string` can still be growing
 * mid-stream for the one actively-streaming edit — caching those would lock
 * in a stale, incomplete diff. Size-capped with FIFO eviction so a very
 * long-lived session doesn't grow this unbounded.
