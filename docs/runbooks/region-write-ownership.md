# Region write-ownership — completion plan & runbook

> **Audience**: anyone working on the multi-region (US / EU / India)
> active-active Postgres mesh.
>
> **Why this exists**: the 2026-06 replication incidents (split-brain
> identities, FK-ordering breaks, `custom_domains` LWW churn, and the
> 2026-06-25 `SSL EOF` flap that rotted `sub_from_india` for hours) all
> trace to the same root cause: **the same logical rows are written in
> more than one region**, on a stack (vanilla CNPG / PG18 logical
> replication) that *detects* conflicts but does **not** resolve them.
> The conflict watchdog (`prod-investigation/recovery/recon/91_conflict_watchdog.sh`)
> keeps the mesh up by skipping/​re-enabling, but it is a bandaid — its
> keep-local skips silently drop data, and it has to be babysat.
>
> **The fix** is to make every logical row **single-writer** (region
> write-ownership / "region-pinned writes"), which is the industry
> best-practice for multi-region Postgres without a purpose-built
> multi-master extension. Once ownership is exhaustive and enforced, the
> conflict class disappears *by design* and the watchdog degrades to an
> alarm rather than a crutch.
>
> This plan covers four workstreams: **(A) table audit**, **(B) enforce
> rollout**, **(C) transport hardening**, **(D) DDL runbook**.

## 0. Current state (as of 2026-06-25, `v1.11.19`)

Already shipped (commit `529a5275`, deployed in **shadow** mode all regions):

- `Workspace.homeRegion` column + index (migration `20260624140000_add_workspace_home_region`).
- `homeRegion` stamped on workspace create (`workspace.service.ts`, generated `workspace.hooks.ts`).
- `apps/api/src/lib/region.ts` — region config (`REGION_ID`, `REGION_PEERS`, `PRIMARY_REGION`, `homeRegionForNewWorkspace()`).
- `apps/api/src/lib/region-peer-proxy.ts` — `proxyToPeer()`.
- `apps/api/src/lib/resolve-workspace-id.ts` — `resolveWorkspaceIdForRequest()`.
- `apps/api/src/middleware/home-region-router.ts` — `homeRegionWriteProxy`, gated by `HOME_REGION_ROUTING={off|shadow|enforce}`, applies to `POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE`.
- Idempotent signup: Better Auth account-linking + hardened `user.create.before` in `auth.ts`.
- Backfill script `scripts/backfill-workspace-home-region.ts` (**not yet run**).

**Gaps this plan closes:**

1. Backfill not run → existing workspaces have `homeRegion = NULL` (router treats NULL as primary, so they're all effectively pinned to US until backfilled — correct but not intentional).
2. Still in `shadow` → nothing is actually proxied; conflicts continue.
3. The router only knows how to resolve **workspace-scoped** writes. **Identity** and **platform/global** tables (see audit) are not yet pinned and remain multi-writer.
4. Transport is unhardened (no keepalives, aggressive `disable_on_error`).
5. No expand/contract DDL discipline → the EU/India "missing `homeRegion` column" break recurs on every schema change.

## The invariant we are enforcing

> **Every table is written in exactly one region per logical row.**

Three ownership classes, three routing rules:

| Class | Owner | Routing rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Workspace-owned** | `workspace.homeRegion` | proxy write to the workspace's home region |
| **Identity / user-global** | the user (global) | idempotent + (decision) pin to user-home or primary |
| **Platform / catalog-global** | the platform | proxy write to `PRIMARY_REGION` (us-ashburn-1) |

---

## Part A — Table audit (90 models)

Generated from `prisma/schema.prisma`. Each model is classified by how a
write resolves to an owner. **Counter/additive tables are flagged 🔴** —
these corrupt under last-write-wins if ownership is ever bypassed, so they
are the highest-priority to get single-writer.

### A1. Workspace-owned — direct `workspaceId` (28)

Route on `workspace.homeRegion`. The router already resolves these via
`resolveWorkspaceIdForRequest()`.

`AgentCostMetric` 🔴, `AgentEvalResult`, `AgentEvalSet`, `ApiKey`,
`BillingAccount` 🔴, `BudgetAlert`, `ChatSession`, `Folder`, `Instance`,
`InstanceSubscription`, `Invitation`, `InviteLink`, `MarketplaceInstall`,
`Meeting`, `Member`, `ModelExperiment`, `Project`, `ProjectAgent`,
`StarredProject`, `StorageUsage` 🔴, `SubagentModelOverride`,
`Subscription`, `UsageEvent` 🔴, `UsageWallet` 🔴, `VoiceCallMeter` 🔴,
`VoiceProjectConfig`, `WorkspaceGrant`, `WorkspaceModelVisibility`
(+ `Workspace` itself).

### A2. Workspace-owned — via `projectId` → `Project.workspaceId` (11)

Router must resolve `project → workspace → homeRegion`. `resolveWorkspaceIdForRequest()`
already handles project paths/params; verify each route below hits that path.

`AgentConfig`, `ChatSessionProject`, `CustomDomain` ⚠️ *(the churn culprit)*,
`FeatureSession`, `GitHubConnection`, `MarketplaceListing`,
`ProjectAttachment`, `ProjectAuthConfig`, `ProjectAuthSignIn`,
`ProjectCheckpoint`, `ProjectFolder`.

### A3. Workspace-owned — via parent/`sessionId` chain (14)

These have no `workspaceId`/`projectId` of their own; they hang off a
session or run that resolves to a project/workspace. The resolver must walk
the chain (most already covered via `ChatSession`/`FeatureSession`).

- `ChatMessage` → `sessionId` → `ChatSession` → workspace
- `ToolCallLog` → `chatSessionId` → `ChatSession`
- `Requirement`, `DesignDecision`, `ClassificationDecision`,
  `AnalysisFinding`, `IntegrationPoint`, `TestCase`, `ImplementationTask`,
  `ImplementationRun`, `TestSpecification`, `TaskExecution`,
  `TaskDependency` → `sessionId` → `FeatureSession` → `Project` → workspace

> **Action**: add explicit resolver coverage + unit tests for the
> session-chain tables (`ChatMessage`, `ToolCallLog`, and the
> `FeatureSession` family). A miss here = the exact FK-ordering break we saw.

### A4. Identity / user-global (12) — **decision required**

A user is not naturally region-pinned (this *was* the split-brain bug).
Idempotent signup (done) stops duplicate `User`/`Account` inserts, but
ongoing profile/session writes can still happen in any region.

`User`, `Account`, `Session`, `Verification`, `Notification`,
`PushSubscription`, `RemoteAction`, `SignupAttribution`, `CreatorProfile`,
`MarketplaceReview`, `Affiliate`, `AffiliateAttribution`.

Two viable strategies (pick one — see Open Decisions):

- **(i) Pin to primary**: route all identity writes to `PRIMARY_REGION`.
  Simplest, fully conflict-free; costs cross-region latency on auth writes.
- **(ii) User-home-region**: add `User.homeRegion`, mirror the workspace
  pattern for identity. Best locality; more work, and "global" tables like
  `Session`/`Verification` still need a rule.

`Session`/`Verification` are short-lived; LWW + idempotency is acceptable
for those regardless of choice.

### A5. Platform / catalog-global (35) — route to `PRIMARY_REGION`

Reference/catalog/marketplace/affiliate-ledger data, written by admins or
platform jobs, read everywhere. Pin **all writes to the primary region**.

`PlatformSetting`, `ModelDefinition`, `ModelProvider`, `Registry`,
`ComponentDefinition`, `ComponentSpec`, `Composition`, `RendererBinding`,
`LayoutTemplate`, `MarketplaceListingVersion`, `MarketplaceTransaction` 🔴,
`LicenseKey`, `CreatorBadge`, `CreatorFollow`, `AffiliateClick`,
`AffiliateCommission` 🔴, `AffiliateCommissionTier`, `AffiliatePayout` 🔴,
`AffiliatePost`, `AffiliatePostSnapshot`, `AffiliateSocialAccount`,
`AnalysisFinding`*, `AnalyticsDigest`, `InfraSnapshot`, `EvalRun`,
`EvalRunResult`, `ModelExperiment`*, `TestSpecification`*, `Requirement`*…

> \* Some appear in both A3 and here depending on who writes them — resolve
> ambiguity during the per-route audit (B1). When in doubt, a table may only
> be in **one** class.

### A6. Audit completion checklist

- [ ] Every model assigned to exactly one class (A1–A5).
- [ ] For A2/A3, confirm the HTTP routes that mutate them flow through
      `resolveWorkspaceIdForRequest()` and resolve non-null.
- [ ] Add a CI guard: a test that fails if a new model with
      `workspaceId`/`projectId` is added without resolver coverage.
- [ ] Every 🔴 counter table verified single-writer (highest priority).

---

## Part B — Enforce rollout

Phased, reversible. Never flip straight to `enforce` globally.

### B1. Pre-flight (shadow analysis)

1. **Run the backfill** (dry-run first), against US primary only:
   ```bash
   bun scripts/backfill-workspace-home-region.ts --dry-run
   bun scripts/backfill-workspace-home-region.ts        # after review
   ```
   Verify `SELECT homeRegion, count(*) FROM workspaces GROUP BY 1;` on all
   three regions (must match — it replicates).
2. **Mine the shadow logs** for ≥48h across all regions:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs -l app=api --since=48h | grep 'home-region-router' \
     | grep would-proxy
   ```
   Confirm: (a) resolved `workspaceId` is non-null for real mutations,
   (b) the would-proxy target region matches expectation, (c) no hot path
   resolves to NULL (= unowned write = future conflict).
3. **Close resolver gaps** found in step 2 (A3 session-chain tables, any
   route not hitting the resolver). Re-deploy shadow, re-mine.

### B2. Enforce, per-class, one region pair at a time

`HOME_REGION_ROUTING` stays a single env var, but roll it region-by-region:

1. **Enforce in EU first** (lowest traffic), keep US/India shadow. Watch
   error rate, proxy latency (`proxyToPeer` adds one cross-region hop on
   non-home writes), and the mesh (`subenabled`, slot lag).
2. **Enforce India**, then **US**.
3. After workspace-owned is stable, extend the router to pin **A5
   platform-global → primary**, then resolve the **A4 identity decision**.

### B3. Success criteria (per step)

- Conflict-class apply errors → **0** new (`pg_stat_subscription_stats`
  deltas flat for `insert_exists`/FK over 24h).
- No subscription self-disables for a conflict reason.
- p99 write latency within budget (cross-region proxy hop is the cost).

### B4. Rollback

Flip the region back to `HOME_REGION_ROUTING=shadow` (env change + restart).
The router fails open (handles locally) when a peer is unreachable or a home
region is unknown — see `home-region-router.test.ts`.

---

## Part C — Transport hardening

Fixes the **connection-drop** class (today's `SSL EOF`), independent of
conflicts. Apply to all three CNPG clusters.

### C1. Keepalives + timeouts on the subscriber conninfo

The cross-region `subconninfo` currently lacks keepalives, so an idle/slow
cross-region socket gets reaped by a NAT/LB and surfaces as
`could not receive data from WAL stream: SSL SYSCALL error: EOF detected`.

Append to every `subconninfo` (per-subscription):
```
keepalives=1 keepalives_idle=30 keepalives_interval=10 keepalives_count=3
```
```sql
ALTER SUBSCRIPTION sub_from_eu
  CONNECTION 'host=... dbname=shogo user=logical_replicator sslmode=require
              keepalives=1 keepalives_idle=30 keepalives_interval=10 keepalives_count=3';
```

### C2. Raise WAL timeouts (CNPG cluster `postgresql.parameters`)

```yaml
wal_sender_timeout: "180s"     # was default 60s; cross-region needs slack
wal_receiver_timeout: "180s"
wal_retrieve_retry_interval: "5s"
```

### C3. Stop letting transient errors disable subscriptions

`disable_on_error=true` treats a *network* hiccup the same as a *data*
conflict — it disables the whole subscription, which (without a persistent
watcher) rots. Two options:

- **Preferred (post-ownership)**: set `disable_on_error=false`. Once Part B
  makes conflicts impossible, the only remaining apply errors are transient
  and should **auto-retry**, not disable.
- **Interim (before ownership is complete)**: keep `disable_on_error=true`
  but run the watchdog as a **persistent** in-cluster CronJob (Part E) so a
  disable self-heals in seconds.

### C4. Verify

```bash
# no EOF disables over 24h
kubectl logs <pg-pod> -c postgres --since=24h | grep -c 'SSL SYSCALL error: EOF'
# all 6 subs enabled, slots active, lag ~0
```

---

## Part D — DDL runbook (expand / contract)

> **Root cause of the EU/India break on 2026-06-25**: logical replication
> **does not replicate DDL**. The deploy pipeline runs migrations per-region
> (`SKIP_MIGRATIONS=false` on every region), and US deploys + starts writing
> the new column *before* EU/India have it — and a non-idempotent
> `ADD COLUMN` then fails as "already exists" if pre-applied, recording a
> **failed migration (P3009)** that blocks the region.

### D1. Rules for every schema change in the mesh

1. **Additive only, in the expand phase.** New columns nullable / with
   defaults; never drop/rename in the same release as code that depends on
   the new shape. (expand → migrate code → contract, across releases.)
2. **Idempotent migration SQL** for anything that might be pre-applied:
   `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`, etc.
3. **Schema lands on ALL regions before any region writes the new shape.**
   Either:
   - **(preferred)** a pre-deploy job that runs `migrate deploy` against all
     three primaries *before* the app rollout, **or**
   - keep the current per-region migrate, but ensure the column-writing code
     path is dark (feature-flagged off) until all regions are migrated.
4. **Never hand-apply DDL out-of-band** (this is what created the P3009).
   If you must, immediately reconcile Prisma state (D3).

### D2. Recommended deploy ordering for mesh-affecting migrations

```
expand DDL to US  ──►  expand DDL to EU  ──►  expand DDL to India
        └──────────── all green ────────────┘
                         ▼
            roll app code (writes new shape)
```
Add a pipeline gate: "schema present on all regions" before the
column-writing image is allowed to take traffic.

### D3. If a migration is recorded as failed (P3009) but the schema is fine

(e.g. column already applied out-of-band). Mark it resolved — do **not**
re-run:
```bash
# preferred: official resolve
bunx prisma migrate resolve --applied <migration_name>
```
or, equivalently, directly:
```sql
UPDATE _prisma_migrations
SET finished_at = now(), applied_steps_count = 1, logs = NULL, rolled_back_at = NULL
WHERE migration_name = '<name>' AND finished_at IS NULL;
```
Then re-run the failed deploy jobs (`gh run rerun <id> --failed`).

### D4. Schema parity

`scripts/check-schema-parity.ts` already gates PG↔SQLite drift; cloud-only
columns (like `homeRegion`) go in its allow-list. Keep that list current.

## Part E — Demote the watchdog to a safety net

The watchdog should **never** be the thing keeping the mesh alive. Target
end-state:

1. **Persistent, in-cluster** watchdog as a `CronJob` (every 1m) in
   `shogo-production-system`, not a laptop loop — *interim* protection while
   Part B/C land.
2. **Alerting** (the missing seatbelt): page on
   - any `pg_subscription.subenabled = false`
   - logical slot lag > threshold or `active = false`
   - apply-error-count delta > 0
3. Once Part B (ownership) + Part C (`disable_on_error=false`) are in place,
   the watchdog's *skip* path is dead code (no conflicts to skip). Keep only
   the **alert**, retire the auto-skip — because every skip is silent data
   loss.

---

## Sequencing (recommended order)

1. **C (transport hardening)** — cheap, immediately stops the EOF-flap class.
2. **E1+E2 (persistent watchdog + alerts)** — interim seatbelt; makes
   everything else safe to roll.
3. **A (finish audit)** + close resolver gaps (A3 session chains).
4. **B1 (backfill + shadow mining)**.
5. **B2 (enforce, EU → India → US)** for workspace-owned.
6. **A5 platform-global → primary**, then **A4 identity decision**.
7. **C3 (`disable_on_error=false`)** + **E3 (retire auto-skip)** once
   conflicts are structurally impossible.

---

## Open decisions

1. **Identity routing (A4)**: pin identity writes to primary *(simpler,
   conflict-free, adds auth-write latency)* vs. add `User.homeRegion`
   *(better locality, more work)*.
2. **Enforce granularity**: single global `HOME_REGION_ROUTING` flag (current)
   vs. per-class flags (lets us enforce workspace-owned while still
   shadowing identity/global).
3. **Long-term**: is hand-rolled write-ownership the destination, or a
   stepping stone to a purpose-built multi-master stack (pgEdge Spock /
   AWS pgactive / EDB PGD) that gives automatic conflict resolution,
   delta-apply counters, global sequences, and **automatic DDL replication**
   (which would delete Part D entirely)? Revisit once Part B proves out the
   ownership model.
